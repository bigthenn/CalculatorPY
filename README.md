# CalculatorPY

This program defines a function called calculate() that takes three arguments: two numbers and a mathematical operator. The function uses an if-elif-else statement to determine which operation to perform, and then returns the result of that operation.

The main part of the program prompts the user for two numbers and a mathematical operator, and then calls the calculate() function to perform the operation. The result is printed to the screen.

Note that this program includes error handling to ensure that the user enters valid input. If the user enters a non-numeric value for one of the numbers, the program will raise a ValueError and ask the user to enter a valid number. If the user enters an invalid operator, the program will raise an ArithmeticError and ask the user to enter a valid operator.
